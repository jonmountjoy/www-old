I'm Jon. I enjoy travel, food, people, wildlife, creating things, and learning.

I'm happiest when combining many of these things: eating with friends in a new place, discussing interesting topics.

In a previous life, I worked at O'Reilly Media, BEA Systems, Salesforce and Heroku.

Today, I work for [TimeToTime.app](https://www.timetotime.app/).
